# Finite State Machine Designer

Originally by @evanw (http://madebyevan.com/fsm/). This is an attempt to modernize the codebase, migrate to a node.js-based build system and to expand the application with new features.

Modified by [@paavohuhtala](https://github.com/paavohuhtala/fsm) in 2016/2017.

This project is meant to be a complete rewrite of the codebase.

## How to build

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run build`

Run `yarn run dev` to start the webpack development server, and then navigate to http://localhost:8080.
